# Jotto

This project was built following the React course by Bonnie Schulkin. We wanted to learn TDD in React with Jest and Enzyme, which provides tools to test React and Redux applications. 

## The plan

## How to run

Comig soon...

### Why TDD?

Test Driven Development helps us write better organized code thatâ€™s easier to maintain, which will save time in the long run. Tests provide value when working in a team as others will know they can rely on our code.

### What we learned

- Write unit and integration tests for React and Redux using Jest and Enzyme.
- Know the tradeoffs for different testing approaches and when to choose which approach.
- Plan your React app more effectively via Test Driven Development.
